.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsimple_shell\fP program is a basic command interpreter, providing a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the operating system. It parses input from the user, locates the specified command in the system's \fBPATH\fP, and executes it with the given arguments. It also includes built-in commands such as \fBexit\fP and \fBenv\fP for basic shell functionality.

The shell operates in either interactive or non-interactive mode, depending on whether standard input is connected to a terminal or a pipe/redirection.
